# **About ultradian.cc**

---

## **Hi, I'm Mohammad Faisal.**
This is my connected thinking space -- built for how ideas actually form, link, and grow.

---

## **The .cc means something to me.**

It's short for **Connected Cognition** -- the simple truth that no thought stands alone.
Every idea you have touches another. Every note you write belongs to a bigger picture.
I built this tool to honor that.

---

## **Why I made this**

Most note-taking tools force you into folders, hierarchies, and linear lists.
But my mind doesn't work that way.
I think in rhythms. In connections. In bursts.

**So I built something that does too.**

---

## **Two principles shape everything here:**

### 1. **Work in rhythm**
Our brains have natural focus cycles -- about 90 minutes at a time.
Ultradian.cc gently reminds you of this pace.
No pressure. No hustle. Just a nudge to work *with* your biology, not against it.

### 2. **Think in connections**
Notes shouldn't be lonely.
Every idea can link, reference, and relate.
Here, your thinking becomes a map -- and the map helps you think.

---

## **What you'll find here**

- **A graph that grows** -- literally. Each connection you make adds a line. Each note is a dot.
- **A timer that breathes** -- 90 minutes on, 20 off. Respect the cycle.
- **Links that go both ways** -- see what points to what, always.
- **No folders** -- just connections. No rigid boxes -- just flow.

---

## **This isn't a productivity tool.**

It's a **thinking tool**.
It doesn't try to organize you.
It tries to *understand* you -- how you link ideas, when you focus, where your thoughts naturally go.

It's built for:
- Writers connecting themes
- Thinkers tracing thoughts
- Builders mapping concepts
- Learners following curiosity
- Anyone who thinks in networks, not lists

---

## **My own .cc story**

I started this as a personal script to visualize my own notes.
Then I added links. Then backlinks. Then a timer based on ultradian science.
Then I realized -- this isn't just for me.
It's for anyone whose ideas don't fit in folders.

So I cleaned it up. Polished the edges. And kept the soul intact.

---

## **A quiet place for connected thought**

This isn't a startup. It's not a company.
It's a **personal tool, shared**.

No upsells. No tiered plans. No "pro" features locked away.
Just the full thing -- the way I use it -- offered openly.

Because connected thinking shouldn't be a premium feature.
It should be how notes work.

---

## **Built with:**

- Respect for your attention
- Belief in linked thought
- Obsession with clean interfaces
- Coffee. Lots of coffee.

---

## **You're welcome here**

Whether you write daily or just think loudly.
Whether you have 10 notes or 10,000.
Whether you're mapping a project or figuring out your own head.

This is a tool for thinking, linking, and finding your rhythm.
It's the notes app I always wanted -- and maybe you did too.

---

**Start simple.**
Write something. Link it to something else.
Watch your mind make connections you couldn't see before.

That's the whole idea.

---

## **Want to say hello?**

I'm Mohammad Faisal. You can reach me at info@ultradian.cc or find me on https://github.com/mohammadzfaisal.
I read every message. I love hearing how people use this -- or how they wish it worked.

This tool grows through use, through feedback, through conversation.
Just like thinking does.

---

**Thank you for visiting,**
and happy thinking.

-- Mohammad Faisal

---

**P.S.** If you're curious about the tech: it's built with Hugo - Html, JSON, Typescript- Sanity.
The source isn't open (yet), but the philosophy is:
*Thoughts belong together. Tools should connect, not contain.*
